    Attribute Explanations:

    Controller:
      • IsSafetyEnabled is what allows direct controlling of the frequency or voltage outputs on the electronics
      • PidLoopInterval is how often to execute PID loop

    AngleControllers (i.e. Yaw and Tilt):
      • IsEnabled is whether the angle controller is enabled (aka doing something) during the PID loop
      • MotorDriver is the type of driver used to control the motor (e.g. AnalogVoltage or Frequency)
      • IntegralWindupThreshold is how close the angle must be to the set point before integral gain kicks in
      • OutputRateLimit is has the max rate at which the output can change per PID loop execution
      • Proportional, Integral and Derivative gains are the PID constants used to tune the controller

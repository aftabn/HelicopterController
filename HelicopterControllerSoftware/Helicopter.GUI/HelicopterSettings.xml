    Attribute Explanations:

    Helicopter:
      • ConnectionType is how the software will communicate with the microcontroller
      • PidThreadRefreshIntervalMilliseconds is the interval at which the software refreshes the angle and outputs from the microcontroller

    Controller:
      • IsSafetyEnabled is what allows direct controlling of the frequency or voltage outputs on the electronics
      • PidLoopInterval is how often to execute PID loop on the microcontroller in milliseconds

    AngleControllers (i.e. Yaw and Tilt):
      • IsEnabled is whether the angle controller is enabled (aka doing something) during the PID loop
      • MotorDriver is the type of driver used to control the motor (e.g. AnalogVoltage or Frequency)
      • IntegralWindupThreshold is how close the angle must be to the set point before integral gain kicks in
      • OutputRateLimit is has the max rate at which the output can change per PID loop execution
      • Proportional, Integral and Derivative gains are the PID constants used to tune the controller
        • These are separated into a clockwise and/or clockwise profile, since the motors do not output the same
          amount of thrust in both directions
